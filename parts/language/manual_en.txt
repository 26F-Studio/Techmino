Gameplay:
        The system will provide you with tetrominoes (4-block pieces),
        with a total of 7 types, and the player needs to control them
        (move left and right, rotate 90, 180 or 270 degrees).
        each row filled with the field will be cleared.
        If there is an opponent, an attack will be sent depending on the line clear type
        Play until the end or achieve the level's goal to win.

Rotation system:
        Uses TRS (Techmino Rotation System) by default. The game allows players to choose other commonly used rotation systems (generally unnecessary)

Spin detection:
        Satisfies "3 corner" rule +2 points
        Satisfies "immobile" rule +2 points
        - As long as one of the above is true, it is a Spin

        If the rotation was not using the second check in the kick table, +1 point
        - The Spin is a Mini if it only has 2 points; the piece is one of S, Z, J, L, T; AND the line clear did not clear the entire piece.

Attack system:
        [TODO]
Back to Back (B2B) gauge:
        [TODO]

Score system:
        The better you play, the higher the score.

Attack delay:
        Attacks from Doubles/Triples take effect the fastest;
        Followed by Techrash, Spins, which send slower attacks;
        High combos are the slowest;
        For B2B or B2B2B, they also increase the attack delay while they increase lines sent;
        Minis will greatly increase the delay.

Countering:
        When you send attacks, if there is garbage in queue,
        extra blocking will be used first, then attack, countering the earliest attack at a 1:1 ratio.
        Any extra blocking you didn't use will be discarded, and finally the remaining attack power will be sent to your opponent.

Battle Royale modes:
        Many players play a game at the same time (against AI bots, not real players).
        As players get eliminated, blocks fall faster, and garbage take effect faster, as well as rise faster.
        Eliminate other players to gain a badge and the player's badge to increase your attack power.
        Players can choose between four attack modes:
                1. Random: Every time you attack, 10% chance to lock onto a random player.
                2. Badges: After you attack or when your target dies, lock onto the player with the most badges.
                3. KOs: After you attack or when your target dies, lock onto the player with the highest field. (Refreshes every second)
                4. Attackers: attack all players locking onto yourself.
                Your attack will be sent to all of them. If you are not targetted, you attack a random player (not locking).
        When all opponents have been eliminated, the last player in the match is the winner.

Custom mode:
        You can freely adjust most parameters (not including special effects of other game modes).
        You can also draw a field to clear or make a template to build.
        In build (puzzle) mode, you can toggle template display with Function key:
                Cells with a X cannot have blocks;
                empty cells can be in any state;
                regular colored cells have to be made of the corresponding block;
                garbage-colored cells can be any block but not air.
        Once you make the shape, you will win.

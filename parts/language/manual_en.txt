Gameplay:
        The system will provide you with tetrominoes (4-block pieces),
        with a total of 7 types, and the player needs to control them
        (move left and right, rotate 90, 180, or 270 degrees).
        Each row filled with the field will be cleared.
        If there is an opponent, an attack will be sent depending on the type of line clear.
        Play until the end or achieve the level’s goal to win.

Rotation system:
        Uses TRS (Techmino Rotation System) by default.
        The game allows players to choose other commonly used rotation systems (generally unnecessary)

Spin detection:
        Satisfies “3-corner” rule +2 points
        Satisfies “immobile” rule +2 points
        - As long as one of the above is true, it is a Spin

        If the rotation was not using the second check in the kick table, +1 point
        - The Spin is a Mini if it only has 2 points; the piece is one of S, Z, J, L, T; AND the line clear did not clear the entire piece.

Attack system:
        Special clear:
                A special clear refers to a situation where you perform a spin, Techrash (or clear more than four lines at a time), PC, or HPC.
                Special clears can elevate the B2B gauge.
        Super clear:
                A super clear refers to a situation where you perform a special clear when the B2B gauge is not empty.

        Special clears (spins):
                sends (lines cleared ×2) attack,
                - B2B sends extra 1/1/2/4/8 for Spin Single/Double/Triple/Techrash/Techrash+
                - B2B2B sends (lines cleared ×0.5) on top of that of B2B, and +1 extra blocking
                - Minis reduces the attack to 25% (×0.25 multiplier)

        Special clears (Techrash/techrash+ without spins):
                - B2B sends 1 additional line
                - B2B2B will have an attack boost of 50% and +1 extra blocking

        Non-special clears:
                send (lines cleared-0.5) attack.

        Combos (REN):
                The numbers of the combos are equal to (the numbers you clear lines consecutively –1) (capped at 12 combos).
                All damage above (except attack from PC/HPC) gets a (combo ×25%) bonus, or (combo ×15%) for Single clear.
                +1 more attack for 2 Combo or more.

        Hemi Perfect Clear (a P.C. “with blocks left below.” If just one line cleared, the remaining blocks must not be player-placed):
                - Attack +4, Extra Blocking +2

        Perfect Clear (All Clear):
                - Sends 8 to 16 (increments within a game by 2 for every PC) OR every other damage above, whichever is higher.
                - +2 extra blocking.

        After calculating the above, the damage value will be rounded down and sent.


Back to Back (B2B) gauge:
        The B2B gauge ranges from 0 to 1,000. Special line clears are B2B if the gauge is ≥ 50, B2B2B if >800.

        Line cleared:
                Special clears:
                - Spin Single/Double/Triple/Techrash/Techrash+ + 50/100/180/800/1000 (×50% if Mini)
                - Techrash/Techrash+ + 150/200/...
                - PC when lines cleared in this round >4, +800
                - HPC, +100
                - A regular line clear -250

        No lines cleared:
                - Spin (0 lines) +20. Note that the B2B gauge cannot exceed 800 using this method.

Score system:
        The better you play, the higher the score.

Attack delay:
        Attacks from Doubles/Triples take effect the fastest;
        Followed by Techrash, Spins, which send slower attacks;
        High combos are the slowest;
        For B2B or B2B2B, they also increase the attack delay while they increase lines sent;
        Minis will significantly increase the delay.

Countering:
        When you send attacks, if there is garbage in the queue,
        extra blocking will be used first, then attack, countering the earliest attack at a 1 : 1 ratio.
        Any additional blocking you didn’t use will be discarded, and finally, the remaining attack power will be sent to your opponent.

Battle Royale modes:
        Many players play a game simultaneously (against AI bots, not actual players).
        As players get eliminated, blocks fall faster, and garbage takes effect and rises faster.
        Eliminate other players to gain a badge and the player’s badge to increase your attack power.
        Players can choose between four attack modes:
                1. Random: Every time you attack, 10% chance to lock onto a random player.
                2. Badges: After you attack or when your target dies, lock onto the player with the most badges.
                3. KOs: Lock onto the player with the highest field after you attack or when your target dies. (Refreshes every second)
                4. Attackers: attack all players locking onto yourself.
                Your attack will be sent to all of them. If you are not targeted, you attack a random player (not locking).
        When all opponents have been eliminated, the last player in the match is the winner.

Custom mode:
        You can freely adjust most parameters (not including special effects of other game modes).
        You can also draw a field to clear or make a template to build.
        In build (puzzle) mode, you can toggle template display with Function key:
                Cells with an X cannot have blocks;
                empty cells can be in any state;
                regular colored cells have to be made of the corresponding block;
                garbage-colored cells can be any block but not air.
        Once you make the shape, you will win.

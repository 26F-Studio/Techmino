Do not use programming practice versions (they are garbage).\n\t2. Build foundations in your skills (stable Tetrises using next queue to aid decisions), don't go for fancy T-Spins from the start.\n\n\tTwo main techniques:\n\t1. familiarize yourself with spawn locations of pieces, and the controls to move the piece into each location\n\t2.

This means that Techmino will not judge a piece as having a finesse error when you soft drop and spin or tuck.\nTechmino also introduced additional checks, such as holding while the current piece and the held piece is the same, or holding after you have manipulated the current piece, count as a finesse fault.\nFinesse% in Techmino is defined to be 100% when par or below par, 50% when one keypress above par, 25% when two keypresses above par, and 0% when three or more keypresses above par.\nAlso note that in 20G finesse still runs as if there were no gravity, which can cause inaccurate results.",

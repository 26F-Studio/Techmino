Don’t use those “primitive” versions which deviate too much from the Guideline and have awful controls. \n\t\t2. Spend time establishing the basic skills, like reading the Next sequence and performing Tetris stably. Don’t learn some fancy skills such as T-spins for now.\n\tTwo Skills:\n\t\t1. Remember the spawn positions of the blocks and controls to move the blocks into the desired locations.\n\t\t2. Plan ahead on where to put down the Next blocks. \n\nThe link below is the translated version (by User670) of an article named “Suggestion for new players to Tetris Online,” which was written by a Chinese Tetris player named Tatianyi (2019).

        "Here are our recommendations for improving your Tetris skills. If you have ever felt difficulties in your training, you can just relax and spend some time playing the modes you do enjoy. Have fun!\n\nThese are sets of missions that you need to accomplish. When there is order within each set, we recommend you to do all three sets of tasks simultaneously instead of one by one.\n\nA. Stacking\n\tA1. Think twice before you place your block. If your first decision doesn’t seem to fit well, think again.\n\tA2. Keep your terrain flat since it allows more possibilities for different blocks.\n\tA3. When hold allowed, thinking more about sequences to arrange the pieces in your hand, the held one, plus the previews. In order to have flat terrain for longer time.\nB. Efficiency & Speed\n\tB1. Don’t count on ghost pieces. Think, with your brain, where this piece would land and what keys you should press. Do it only when you are ready.\n\tB2. Use both of the rotation keys. Don’t just use one and press it many times when you can press the other one just once.\n\tB3. Don’t worry too much about your speed when you start learning Finesse. Keep your move accurate, and then it is not hard to improve your speed once you have mastered it.\nC. Stacking\n\tC1. Finish 40L without topping out.\n\tC2. Finish 40L with no Hold without topping out.\n\tC3. Finish 40L with all Techrashes.\n\tC4. Finish 40L with all Techrashes and no Hold.\n\nSet C is more flexible, and you can adjust the difficulties based on your own conditions (like what does “stably” means to you).\n\nWhen you finish all the tasks in set C, keep practicing A1. This is the fundamental skill in any Tetris game, and you can master practically any mode when you can just scan through the Next sequence easily.",

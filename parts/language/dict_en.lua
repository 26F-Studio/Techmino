Games like Techmino, TETR.IO, Jstris, and Tetris Online are some good choices. Low quality games that deviate too much from the guidelines, or those with poor controls, are not good for your training.\n\t\t2. Spend time building basic skills in the beginning. Try to spend more time on skills such as reading the next sequence and performing Tetrises consistently. Master the basics before trying more advanced skills like T-spins.\nEssential skills:\n\t\t1. Memorizing the spawn positions of the blocks.\n\t\t2. Remembering the maneuvers to move the blocks to the desired locations.\n\t\t3. Thinking ahead about where to place the blocks in the next sequences.\n\nThe globe button links to an article called \"Suggestion for new players to Tetris Online\" written by Tatianyi, a Chinese Tetris player (translated to English by User670).",

        "Here are our recommendations for improving your Tetris skills. Having trouble improving your skills? Try relaxing and spending more time playing modes you enjoy. Have fun!\n\nHere are three sets of tasks that we feel are essential. Although the tasks within each group are ordered by difficulty, we recommend working on all three sets of tasks simultaneously (rather than one at a time).\n\nA. Stacking\n\tA1. Think twice before placing the block. If your first choice doesn't seem like a good fit, think again.\n\tA2. Keep the terrain flat, as this allows more placement possibilities for different blocks.\n\tA3. If you are playing a game mode that has Holds, think about the three blocks you can use — the current piece, the piece in the Hold, and the next piece. Think about the best order to place these blocks so that you can maintain a flat terrain for longer.\nB. Efficiency & Speed\n\tB1. Do not rely too much on ghost pieces. Instead, think about what keys to press to get the piece to where you want it. Start manipulating the block when you have a clear idea in mind.\n\tB2. Use both rotation keys. Instead of rotating clockwise three times, try rotating counterclockwise just once.\n\tB3. It's okay to go slow when you first start learning Finesse. If you can get your keystrokes right in the beginning, it's not that hard to speed up once you've mastered it.\nC. Stacking\n\tC1. Finish 40L without topping out.\n\tC2. Finish 40L with no Hold without topping out.\n\tC3. Finish 40L with Techrashes only.\n\tC4. Finish 40L with Techrashes only no Hold.\n\nSet C is more flexible for individual players, and you can also adjust the pace based on your own conditions (e.g., how stable is \"stable\" for you).\n\nKeep practicing A1 when you have finished set C. This is the most basic skill in all of Tetris, and it is easy to master everything else when you are a master of reading the Next sequence.",

It is very hard to master T-spins by just focusing on the local terrain; good abilities of stacking and next-reading are also required to master this skill.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you master the basic skills (like stacking) before attempting to learn T-spins.\n\nWe recommend starting with T-Spins if you can meet the following criteria:\n- Finishing 40L within 60 s (or 40–120s, based on personal conditions)\n- Finishing 40L with Tetrises only\n- Finishing 40L with Tetrises only and no Hold (without significantly slowing down)\n\nThis ensures that you are good at next-reading and planning.",

        "Using both rotation buttons (clockwise and counterclockwise) would reduce the number of keystrokes, since rotating three times in one direction is the same as rotating once in the opposite direction. This is also a prerequisite for learning finesse.\nBy using all three rotation buttons (adding 180° rotation), one can use one keypress to rotate any block into its desired orientation (when spins are not considered). \nHowever, we do not recommend that you spend too much time practicing with all three rotation buttons. This is because not all Tetris games have 180° rotations, and using three rotations would not increase your speed significantly compared to using just two. It is not a necessary skill unless you want to pursue extremely high speed.",

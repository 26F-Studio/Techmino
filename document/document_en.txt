Gameplay:
	The system will provide you with tetrominoes (4-block pieces), with a total of 7 types, and the player needs to control them (move left and right, rotate 90, 180 or 270 degrees), and each row filled with the field will be cleared, and depending on the line clear type, an attack will be sent (if there is an opponent)
	Play until the end or achieve the level's goal to win.

Rotation system:
	Uses Techmino's custom rotation system. Too lazy to write the details

Spin detection:
	Satisfies "3 corner" rule +2 points
	Satisfies "immobile" rule +2 points
	- As long as one of the above is true, it is a Spin

	If the rotation was not using the second check in the kick table, +1 point
	- The Spin is a Mini if it only has 2 points; the piece is one of S, Z, J, L, T; AND the line clear did not clear the entire piece.

Attack system:
	Normal line clears (1 to 3 lines):
		Sends (lines cleared -0.5) attack
	Special line clears:
		Spin sends (lines cleared x2) attack,
		  - B2B sends extra 1/1/2/4/8 (for Spin Single/Double/Triple/Techrash/Techrash+ respectively)
		  - B2B2B sends (lines cleared x0.5), and +1 extra blocking
		  - Minis reduces the attack to 25% (x0.25 multiplier)
		Non-Spin Techrash/Techrash+ sends (lines cleared) attack,
		  - B2B sends 1 additional line
		  - B2B2B will have an attack boost of 50% and +1 extra blocking

	Special line clears will the increase B2B gauge, making later special line clears have either a B2B or B2B2B bonus (see below)
	Half Perfect Clear (a Perfect Clear "with blocks left below". If it's an I clearing 1 line, then the remaining blocks must not be player-placed): Attack +2, Extra Blocking +2
	Perfect Clear (also known as All Clear): half the sum of the damage above, plus additional 8 to 20 attack (increasing by 2 in a single round for each PC) and +2 extra blocking. (note: if lines cleared in this round >4, then B2B gauge will be filled)
	Combos: All damage above will be given a (combo x25%) bonus, or (combo x15%) if the line clear is a Single, capped at 12 combo. +1 more attack for 3 Combo or more.
	After calculating all above, the damage value will be rounded down then sent

Score system:
	The better you play, the higher the score.

Attack delay:
	Attacks from Doubles/Triples take effect the fastest, followed by Techrash, Spins, which send slow attacks, and high combos are the slowest
	For B2B or B2B2B, while they increase lines sent, they also increase the attack delay. Minis will greatly increase the delay.

Countering:
	When you send attacks, if there is garbage in queue, extra blocking will be used first, then attack, countering the earliest attack at a 1:1 ratio.
	Any extra blocking you didn't use will be discarded, and finally the remaining attack power will be sent to your opponent.

Back to Back (B2B) gauge:
	The B2B gauge ranges from 0 to 1,200. Special line clears are B2B when the gauge is >=40, and B2B2B if >1,000.
	Normal line clears -250
	Spin Single/Double/Triple/Techrash/Techrash+ +50/100/180/1000/1200 (Mini reduces it to 25%)
	Techrash/Techrash+ +100/200
	Spin (0 lines) +20. Do note that the B2B gauge cannot exceed 1000 using this method.
	When gauge is above 1,000, a drop without clearing lines decreases it by 40, but cannot drop below 1,000

Battle Royale modes:
	Many players play a game at the same time (against AI bots, not real players). As players get eliminated, blocks fall faster, and garbage take effect faster, as well as rise faster. Eliminate other players to gain a badge and the player's badge to increase your attack power.
	Players can choose between four attack modes:
		1. Random: Every time you attack, 10% chance to lock onto a random player.
		2. Badges: After you attack or when your target dies, lock onto the player with the most badges.
		3. KOs: After you attack or when your target dies, lock onto the player with the highest field. (This refreshes every second)
		4. Attackers: attack all players locking onto yourself. Your attack will be sent to all of them. If you are not targetted, you attack a random player (not locking).
	When all opponents have been eliminated, the last player in the match is the winner.

Custom mode:
	You can freely adjust most parameters (not including special effects of other game modes), and you can also draw a field to clear or make a template to build.
	In build (puzzle) mode, you can toggle template display with Function key. Cells with a X cannot have blocks; empty cells can be in any state; regular colored cells have to be made of the corresponding block; garbage-colored cells can be any block but not air. Once you make the shape, you will win.

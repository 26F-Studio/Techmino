Gameplay:
	System will offer a series of tetrominoes ("Pieces". There are 7 types), and the player needs to control [them] (move left and right, rotate 90, 180 or 270 degrees), filling a row on the play field will clear it, attack will be sent depending on the type of the line clear (if there is an opponent)
	Survive till the last or complete the level's goal to win.

Rotation system:
	Uses Techmino's custom rotation system. Too lazy to write the details

Spin detection:
	Satisfies "3 corner" rule +2 points
	Satisfies "immobile" rule +2 points
	- As long as one of the above is true, it is a Spin

	If the rotation was not using the second check in the kick table, +1 point
	- The Spin is a Mini if it only has 2 points; the piece is one of S, Z, J, L, T; AND the line clear did not clear the entire piece.

Attack system:
	Regular line clears (clearing <=3 lines):
		Sends (lines cleared -0.5) attack
	Special line clears:
		Spin sends (lines cleared x2) attack,
		  - B2B sends extra 1/1/2/4/8 (for Spin Single/Double/Triple/Techrash/Techrash+ respectively)
		  - B2B2B sends (lines cleared x0.5), and +1 extra blocking
		  - If it's a Mini, x0.25
		Non-Spin Techrash/Techrash+ sends (lines cleared) attack,
		  - B2B sends extra 1 attack,
		  - B2B2B sends 50% more attack and +1 extra blocking.

	Special line clears will increase B2B gauge, making later special line clears have B2B or B2B2B bonus (see below)
	Half Perfect Clear (a Perfect Clear "with blocks left below". If it's an I clearing 1 line, then the remaining blocks must not be player-placed): Attack +2, Extra Blocking +2
	Perfect Clear: half all damage above, then +8 to +20 attack (increases within a round by +2 per Perfect Clear) and +2 extra blocking. (note: if lines cleared in this round >4, then B2B gauge will be filled)
	Combos: All damage above will be given a (combo x25%) bonus, or (combo x15%) if the line clear is a Single, capped at 12 combo. +1 more attack for 3 Combo or more.
	After calculating all above, the damage value will be rounded down then sent

Score system:
	The more impressive you play, the more score you get

Attack delay:
	Attack from Doubles/Triples take effect the faster, then Techrash, Spins send rather slow attack, and high combos will send the slowest
	B2B or B2B2B, while they increase lines sent, they also increase the attack delay. Minis will greatly increase delay.

Countering:
	When you send attack, if there is garbage in queue, extra blocking will be used first, then attack, countering the earliest attack at a 1:1 ratio.
	Unused extra blocking will be discarded, then remaining attack will be sent to your opponent.

Back to Back (B2B) gauge:
	The B2B gauge ranges from 0 to 1,200. Special line clears are B2B if the gauge is >=40, B2B2B if >1,000.
	A regular line clear -250
	Spin Single/Double/Triple/Qudra/Penta +50/100/180/1000/1200 (x25% if Mini)
	Techrash/Techrash+ +100/200
	Spin without clearing lines +20, but gauge cannot exceed 1,000 with this method
	When gauge is above 1,000, a drop without clearing lines -40 (cannot drop below 1,000 with this method)

Battle Royale modes:
	Many players play within one game (all opponents are bots, not real players). As players get eliminated, blocks fall faster, and garbage take effect faster, as well as rise faster. KO-ing another player grants you one badge plus all badge that player has, increasing your attack power.
	Players can select one of 4 attack modes:
		1. Random: Every time you attack, 10% chance to lock onto a random player.
		2. Badges: After you attack or when your target dies, lock onto the player with the most badges.
		3. KOs: After you attack or when your target dies, lock onto the player with the highest field. (This refreshes every second)
		4. Counter: attack all players locking onto yourself. Your attack will be sent to all of them. If you are not targetted, you attack a random player (not locking).
	The last survivor wins.

Custom mode:
	You can freely adjust most parameters (not including special effects of other game modes), and you can also draw a field to clear or make a template to build.
	In build (puzzle) mode, you can toggle template display with Function key. Cells with a X cannot have blocks; empty cells can be in any state; regular colored cells have to be made of the corresponding block; garbage-colored cells can be any block but not air. Once you make the shape, you will win.
